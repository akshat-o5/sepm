            Scope of the Project:
            <br>
            • Advancement in virtual mouse with help of AI.
            <br>
            • Make Extension compatible with different website format.

            The AI virtual mouse system is useful for many applications; it can be used to reduce the space for using the physical mouse, and it can be used in situations where we cannot use the physical mouse. The system eliminates the usage of devices, and it improves the human-computer interaction
